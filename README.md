The UFO-level-1 folder contains a static folder and an index.html. Within the static folder there exists js, css,
and image folders. The css and image folders contain components referenced by index.html (formatting code and images).
The js folder contains two js files: data and app.js. The data file contains data reference by the app and posted on
the html site depending on input values. app.js contains javascript code that uses D3 to select objects on the index.html
page and user input to filter data values and populate these values onto the html page. Directions for use are given below.

Open the index.html file and type a date (ranging from 01/1/2010 to 01/13/2010). After clicking on the button below
the input box a list of UFO sightings with location, comments, and other information will populate the webpage if a sighting
exists in the dataset. 

Comments: Future improvements could/will include an error message or notification to the user if the input date is 
of an incorrect format or not within the dataset (not in this current version).
